//! # converge-policy
//!
//! Cedar-based policy enforcement as Suggestors for the Converge Engine.
//!
//! Policy gates participate INSIDE the convergence loop — they evaluate
//! proposals against Cedar policies and write constraints for violations.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use converge_policy::{PolicyGateSuggestor, PolicyEngine};
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! let engine = PolicyEngine::from_policy_str(EXPENSE_APPROVAL_POLICY)?;
//! let gate = PolicyGateSuggestor::new(Arc::new(engine));
//! converge_engine.register_suggestor(gate);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Available Suggestors
//!
//! - [`PolicyGateSuggestor`] — Cedar policy evaluation
//! - [`DelegationVerifySuggestor`] — Ed25519 delegation chain verification
//! - [`FlowGateSuggestor`] — Flow-level authorization gates
